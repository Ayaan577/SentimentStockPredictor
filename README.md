# SentimentStockPredictor
## Overview
A hybrid ML framework combining sentiment analysis and deep learning models to predict stock prices. Using Twitter for sentiment data, LSTM models for time-series forecasting, and GANs for enhanced prediction accuracy.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Processes Twitter data using NLTK's VADER to extract sentiment scores (positive, neutral, negative, and compound).  
- **Technical Indicators**: Computes moving averages, Bollinger Bands, MACD, and more for financial analysis.  
- **LSTM Model**: Predicts stock prices using historical data and sentiment features.  
- **GAN Integration**: Enhances predictions by generating synthetic data to improve model robustness.  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Metrics include RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and RÂ² Score.
